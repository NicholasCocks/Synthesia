1. why are resizeVisualizer() and drawVisualizer() immediately invoked? 


## Why did I choose this project?
1. Focus on frontend - as per mentioned in the last interview.
2. Lots of math, which will be needed in a finance adjacent role.

## How does it work?
1. Drawing triggers Sampler triggers Visualizer
2. the draw method uses quadratic lines for smoother and less pixalted brush (please get .gif of what it looked like before)

## What else to talk about?
1. Debouncing pattern (comes from eletrical engineering)
2. requestAnimationFrame for performance
